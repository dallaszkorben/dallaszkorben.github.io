<p class="message">

The original intention of this page was to collect all useful information what I learned and what I'm interested in.
My goal was to use this page as a reminder not as a basic tutorial.

<br><br>
Most of the part of these pages are not my original ideas. 
I searched for them on the internet, selected the most relevant and collected them here.

<br><br>
All suggestions and constructive criticism welcome.
