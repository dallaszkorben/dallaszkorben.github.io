There are lot of different definition of software quality. One of them is the following:
When we talk about the quality we look at two things:

## 1. Quality of design
It answers the question: `How well the software is designed?`
It is the quality which the producer or supplier is intending to offer to the customer.
It should take into consideration the customer's requirements.

Quality of design is usually indicated by completeness and correctness of 
**specifications**, **drawings**, **catalogues**, etc. and is measured with `fitness for use`.

## 2. Quality of conformance
It answers the question: `How well the software conforms to that design?`

It is often described as the `fitness for purpose` of a piece of software.

# Non-functional requirements

However besides these there are other components which determine the quality. These are the non-functional requirements.

- **Functional Suitability** (functional appropriateness) 
*–Does the function facilitate the completion of the user’s task(s) and objectives?*
If the user doesn’t want to print on that printer or wants to print a PDF but isn’t given those options, then maybe not.
- **Performance Efficiency** (time behavior)
*–Does the printer function respond within three seconds?*
- **Compatibility** (interoperability) 
*–Can the user print over a variety of networks and printers and on computers with different operating systems (Windows and Mac)?*
- **Usability** (learnability) 
*–Can the user figure out how to print or will it take a rocket scientist?*
- **Reliability** (recoverability) 
*– When the printer is unplugged in the middle of printing a task, is the user notified?*
- **Security** (non-repudiation) 
*–Is there a record that the printer printed the file successfully?*
- **Maintainability** (testability) 
*–Can test criteria be specified for the print function?*
- **Portability** (adaptability) 
*–Can the software automatically adapt to new printer models, or an update in printer driver software? Can the print function provide shortcuts for highly sophisticated users?*
