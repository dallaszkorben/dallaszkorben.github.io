# Basic definitions

There are many different definitios for the problems that arise during development. 

My favorits are the following:
- A human can make an `error` or `mistake`
- The **error/mistake** produces `defect` or `bug` in the program code or in a document
- If a defect in code is executed it can cause `failure`
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.image_folder}}/testing/error-mistake.png"  />



A found the following in another place but it is analogous to the previous definition:
- A `mistake` in coding is called `error`
- `error` found by tester is called `defect`
- `defect` accepted by development team then it is called `bug`
- build does not meet the requirements then it is `failure`
